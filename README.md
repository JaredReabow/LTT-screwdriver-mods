files relating to modifications for the LTT screwdriver

These models require a 0.2mm nozzle and a regid filament such as PETG, PLA or ABS.
They simply clip onto the screwdriver internal shaft, however, when printed you will need to remove the bulging brim material from the print 1st layer as the tolerances are miniscule!
i use a utility blade and champher all the edges until i have a clean part.
